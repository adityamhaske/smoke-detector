## Abstract
Nowadays gas leakage and gas detection is a major problem in our daily lives. LPG
gas is highly flammable and can inflict damage to life and property. To avoid such
situations, a considerable amount of effort has been devoted to the development of
reliable techniques for detecting gas leakage. Here we have developed an Arduino
based LPG gas detector alarm. If gas leakage occurs, this system detects it and makes
an alert by buzzing the buzzer attached with the circuit. Our aim is to reduce the risks
in Kitchen using Internet of Things. Gas sensor are used to detect gas leakages in a
kitchen. This project aims at detecting any Gas Leakage in homes and raise the usual
sound and light alarm by using the IoT oriented Gas Leakage Detection System.

## Problem Definition
To design and implement IOT based LPG gas leakage detector. The detection system
also includes an alarm and also an LCD panel to alert the users. The system is
implemented as Arduino LPG based gas detector alarm.

## Features
 Safety Measures
 Alerting Alarm System
 Prevention of damage to life and property.
 Study based on properties of LPG.
 Reliability, usability, portable
